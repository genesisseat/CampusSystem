# Reusable Database CRUD Pattern for ASP.NET Department Apps

This document explains how the Testing department implements a simple, reusable database interaction pattern that can be copied to other ASP.NET department applications in this campus system.

## Goal

The goal is to let a departmental app do the following without creating a large framework:

1. Submit data to a remote MariaDB database
2. Choose a database and table from the UI
3. View table contents
4. Edit rows
5. Delete rows
6. Keep the pattern safe, predictable, and easy to copy to another app

## Core ideas

### 1. Use a single page as a testing and reference UI

The page at `Pages/Index.cshtml` acts as a reference implementation. It keeps:

- form submission for insert
- database chooser
- table chooser
- table viewer
- row edit/delete actions

This gives a department an easy place to learn and copy the pattern before moving it into a proper feature page.

### 2. Keep database access in the Razor Page model

For a small department app, the simplest pattern is:

- page model handles `GET` and `POST`
- database calls use `MySqlConnection` and `MySqlCommand`
- `BindProperty` binds values from HTML inputs
- results are rendered directly into the page

This pattern is easier for other departments to understand than introducing a full repository layer too early.

### 3. Prefer parameterized queries

Always use parameterized queries for values like:

- `name`
- `email`
- `id`
- any user input

Example:

```csharp
await using var command = new MySqlCommand(sql, connection);
command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@name", Name);
command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@email", Email);
```

This prevents SQL injection and is the standard ASP.NET + MySQL pattern.

### 4. Use a connection string in `appsettings.json`

Each department should keep its own `DefaultConnection` or department-specific connection string in `appsettings.json`.

Example:

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=100.98.41.69;Port=3306;Database=mydb;Uid=myuser;Pwd=strongpassword;"
}
```

This keeps environment-specific configuration out of code and easy to replace per deployment.

### 5. Use table discovery queries for generic display

For a generic viewer, use:

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
SHOW TABLES FROM `database_name`;
SELECT * FROM `database_name`.`table_name`;
```

This lets the UI discover what is available without hardcoding all table names.

### 6. Detect the primary key automatically

For edit and delete actions, use the schema metadata to find a row identifier:

```sql
SELECT COLUMN_NAME
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = @db AND TABLE_NAME = @table AND COLUMN_KEY = 'PRI'
LIMIT 1;
```

This is important because row updates and deletes should use the primary key instead of assuming a column name like `id` exists.

### 7. Confirm destructive actions in the browser

Use `confirm()` in the HTML before deleting a row:

```html
<button type="submit" onclick="return confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this row?');">
    Delete
</button>
```

This protects users from accidental data removal.

## Minimal reusable pattern

### Step 1: Add MySqlConnector package

```powershell
dotnet add package MySqlConnector
```

### Step 2: Add a connection string

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=100.98.41.69;Port=3306;Database=mydb;Uid=myuser;Pwd=strongpassword;"
}
```

### Step 3: Use a page model with:

- `BindProperty` for form fields
- a `GET` method to load options and rows
- `POST` methods for insert, update, delete
- helper methods to fetch database and table lists
- helper method to detect the primary key

### Step 4: Use a UI with:

- insert form
- database drop-down
- table drop-down
- table viewer
- row action buttons with confirmation prompts

## Example insert pattern

```csharp
const string sql = "INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES (@name, @email);";
await using var command = new MySqlCommand(sql, connection);
command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@name", Name);
command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@email", Email);
await command.ExecuteNonQueryAsync();
```

## Example table load pattern

```csharp
var query = $"SELECT * FROM `{dbName}`.`{tableName}`;";
await using var command = new MySqlCommand(query, connection);
await using var reader = await command.ExecuteReaderAsync();
```

## Example delete pattern

```csharp
var sql = $"DELETE FROM `{db}`.`{table}` WHERE `{idColumn}` = @id;";
await using var command = new MySqlCommand(sql, connection);
command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@id", rowId);
await command.ExecuteNonQueryAsync();
```

## Example update pattern

```csharp
var sql = $"UPDATE `{db}`.`{table}` SET `name` = @p_name WHERE `id` = @rowId;";
```

## Good departments to apply this to

This pattern is useful for any department that needs simple record handling, including:

- Faculty Portal
- Registrar
- Finance
- Library
- Guidance Department
- Student Portal

## Important caution

This pattern is intentionally simple and works well for internal CRUD testing. Before moving to production, add:

- role-based authorization
- validation rules
- proper password hashing
- audit logging
- transaction handling
- consistency checks
- input sanitization beyond simple form validation

## Reuse instructions for other departments

To copy this pattern:

1. Create a new Razor Page or replace the department home page.
2. Keep the same `MySqlConnector` package reference.
3. Update the connection string and table names.
4. Replace the insert fields with the real department data model.
5. Keep the same `SHOW DATABASES` / `SHOW TABLES` / `SELECT *` pattern for viewing.
6. Keep the `confirm()` delete action.
7. Add a custom `id` detection helper for each table.

This keeps the implementation generic enough to be copied across all department apps without changing the overall architecture.
