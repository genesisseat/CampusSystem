# Finance Department Project Documentation

**Scope:** `Departments/Finance/FinanceMain` only  
**Reviewed:** 2026-09-19  
**Application:** ASP.NET Core Razor Pages, target framework `net10.0`

This document is the programmer handoff and maintenance guide for the Finance department. Paths are relative to the repository root unless marked as an absolute location. Keep Finance changes inside this department unless a shared contract or platform change has been approved.

## Current state

The Finance application is currently a presentation shell for billing, invoices, payments, and financial aid. The visible finance actions do not load financial data, submit forms, download files, or process payments.

The server-side files currently registered in `Program.cs` implement a separate student-request/counselor workflow. They are not connected to the finance Razor Pages and should not be described as billing or payment functionality. Treat this as an implementation mismatch to resolve before adding production finance behavior.

## Project map

## Frontend editing guide

### Page locations and responsibilities

| Route | File | Current behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | `Departments/Finance/FinanceMain/Pages/Index.cshtml` | Finance Center overview and links/context |
| `/Billing` | `Departments/Finance/FinanceMain/Pages/Billing.cshtml` | Empty billing/invoice table, search/status controls, export placeholder |
| `/Invoice` | `Departments/Finance/FinanceMain/Pages/Invoice.cshtml` | Placeholder invoice detail, empty line items, PDF button placeholder |
| `/Payments` | `Departments/Finance/FinanceMain/Pages/Payments.cshtml` | Empty payment history table and statement button placeholder |
| `/Pay` | `Departments/Finance/FinanceMain/Pages/Pay.cshtml` | Non-submitting amount/method preview form |
| `/Aid` | `Departments/Finance/FinanceMain/Pages/Aid.cshtml` | Placeholder aid totals and pending status |
| `/Privacy` | `Departments/Finance/FinanceMain/Pages/Privacy.cshtml` | Privacy page |
| error page | `Departments/Finance/FinanceMain/Pages/Error.cshtml` | Error display |

### What to edit for UI-only work

1. Edit the relevant `.cshtml` file under `Pages/` for labels, layout, table columns, empty states, and page content.
2. Edit `Pages/Shared/_Layout.cshtml` for navigation, shared scripts, page title structure, or footer changes.
3. Edit `wwwroot/css/site.css` for colors, spacing, responsive behavior, forms, tables, and shared components.
4. Edit `wwwroot/js/site.js` only for browser-side behavior. Confirm the file is loaded by `_Layout.cshtml` before adding page-specific behavior.
5. Add a page-specific `.cshtml.cs` model beside a page only when the page needs server-side binding or a handler. Existing page-model files are `Index.cshtml.cs`, `Privacy.cshtml.cs`, and `Error.cshtml.cs`.

### UI rules

- Preserve the existing Bootstrap structure and local CSS variables.
- Keep payment, export, download, and financial-aid controls visibly non-functional until an approved backend contract exists.
- Do not put database writes, payment processing, or hidden API calls in a Razor view.
- Use accessible labels, meaningful empty states, validation messages, and keyboard-operable controls when real forms are introduced.
- Do not expose financial or personally identifiable information in HTML, logs, query strings, or client-side storage.

## Backend editing guide

### Correct locations by backend responsibility

| Responsibility | Location to edit |
|---|---|
| Register a Finance service | `Departments/Finance/FinanceMain/Program.cs` |
| Define request/response DTOs or Finance enums | `Departments/Finance/FinanceMain/Contracts/ServiceContracts.cs` |
| Define input validation | `Departments/Finance/FinanceMain/Contracts/Validators.cs` or a new Finance validator file |
| Implement Finance business logic | `Departments/Finance/FinanceMain/Services/` |
| Define service interfaces | Matching `I*.cs` file in `Departments/Finance/FinanceMain/Services/` |
| Add persistence | Add Finance-owned DbContext/models/migrations inside this project; do not add Finance tables to another department's context |
| Add HTTP API endpoints | A Finance-local controller under `Departments/Finance/FinanceMain/Controllers/` or approved Razor Page handlers |
| Configure JWT, payment, or data-provider settings | `appsettings.json` plus environment-specific configuration; never commit secrets |
| Add security headers | `Departments/Finance/FinanceMain/Services/SecurityHeadersExtensions.cs`, then explicitly register the extension in `Program.cs` if required |

### Backend implementation sequence for real finance features

1. Define the Finance contract and authorization rules.
2. Add validation for amounts, identifiers, dates, status transitions, and idempotency keys.
3. Add Finance-owned persistence and migrations if data must survive process restarts.
4. Implement the service interface and transaction/error behavior.
5. Register the service in `Program.cs`.
6. Add an authorized endpoint or page handler and map only the required fields to the UI.
7. Add audit events for payment, invoice, aid, export, and authorization-sensitive operations.
8. Add tests for authorization, validation, retries, duplicate requests, concurrency, and failure paths.

Do not connect a payment provider, create production billing calculations, or add cross-department controller/service calls without an approved contract and security review.

## Function inventory

This inventory reflects functions present in Finance-local code at the review date. “Implemented” means code exists; it does not mean the function is connected to a finance page or production storage.

### Finance functions currently missing

No Finance-local function currently loads or calculates:

- invoice records or line items;
- account balances;
- payment history;
- payment authorization, capture, refund, or reconciliation;
- PDF invoice or statement generation;
- scholarship, award, disbursement, or remaining-aid data;
- Finance database persistence or migrations.

The buttons and controls for these operations are view-only placeholders in `Pages/Billing.cshtml`, `Pages/Invoice.cshtml`, `Pages/Payments.cshtml`, `Pages/Pay.cshtml`, and `Pages/Aid.cshtml`.

## Configuration and dependencies

- `FinanceMain.csproj` targets `net10.0` and references Entity Framework Core, JWT bearer authentication, FluentValidation, CsvHelper, Polly, and AspNetCoreRateLimit.
- `Program.cs` currently calls `UseAuthorization()` but does not configure authentication middleware or JWT bearer options. Reconcile this before exposing authenticated Finance endpoints.
- `Program.cs` registers in-memory stores, so data and refresh tokens are lost when the process stops.
- Store secrets such as `Jwt:SigningKey` outside committed JSON files using the supported environment or secret-management mechanism.
- Review `appsettings.json`, `appsettings.Development.json`, and `Properties/launchSettings.json` before changing ports, URLs, or environment behavior.

## Verification checklist

After frontend-only changes:

```powershell
dotnet build .\Departments\Finance\FinanceMain\FinanceMain.csproj
```

For backend changes, also verify:

- authorized and unauthorized requests;
- validation and error response behavior;
- duplicate/idempotent requests;
- row-version/concurrency conflicts;
- audit records and PII redaction;
- restart behavior when persistent data is expected;
- payment and financial-aid data is not exposed to the wrong user.

## Documentation maintenance

Update this file whenever a Finance page, route, service, contract, DTO, model, persistence layer, authorization rule, or external integration changes. Keep the function inventory aligned with the source and remove entries when files are deleted or responsibilities move.
