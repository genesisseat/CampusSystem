## Role of the Maintenance Dashboard

The maintenance layer monitors the health of each department, runs debug/build checks, reports service status, tracks operational logs, and provides a shared UI for system activity. It also includes the swarm configuration used for campus review automation and planning.

## Maintenance Assets

- [Maintenance/index.html](Maintenance/index.html) — central dashboard UI
- [Maintenance/AI-CONTEXT_DepartmentMaintainance .md](Maintenance/AI-CONTEXT_DepartmentMaintainance%20.md) — maintenance-specific AI context
- [Maintenance/Agenswarmspec.md](Maintenance/Agenswarmspec.md) — swarm specification and behavior notes
- [Maintenance/Run-MaintenanceMonitoring.bat](Maintenance/Run-MaintenanceMonitoring.bat) — maintenance monitoring launcher
- [Maintenance/Start-MaintenanceDashboard.ps1](Maintenance/Start-MaintenanceDashboard.ps1) — dashboard startup script
- [Maintenance/logs](Maintenance/logs) — operational and monitoring logs
- [Maintenance/swarm](Maintenance/swarm) — swarm planning and review configuration
  - [Maintenance/swarm/PLAN.md](Maintenance/swarm/PLAN.md)
  - [Maintenance/swarm/campus-review-swarm.json](Maintenance/swarm/campus-review-swarm.json)

## Summary

This project is structured as a campus system with:

- one central dashboard and operational view
- several independent department apps
- one department-specific AI context file per app
- shared support folders for infrastructure, requirements, and maintenance operations
- a maintenance swarm layer for planning and review tasks

This gives each department its own project boundary while keeping the campus platform organized in one VS Code workspace.
